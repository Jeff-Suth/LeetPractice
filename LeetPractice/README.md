# Hello There!

Welcome to my Github repository, you'll find me messing around a lot trying to figure out what's going on...

Ignore the works in progress as I try to figure out things. I'll keep things updated as I solve LeetCode problems as a cave man and prepare cave man descriptions to help other cave people get through them.

Expecting to work on a couple for fun game projects to jump start my learning and some data science projects as well!
