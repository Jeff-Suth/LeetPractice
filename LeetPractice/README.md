# Hello There!

Welcome to my Github repository, you'll find me messing around a lot trying to figure out what's going on...

Ignore the works in progress as I try to figure out things. I'll keep things updated as I solve LeetCode problems as a cave man and prepare cave man descriptions to help other cave people get through them.

Expecting to work on a couple for fun game projects to jump start my learning and some data science projects as well!

Problem 1 - TwoSum

Okay for the first problem most users see on LeetCode it's a very good question that touches on a lot of different topics.

For my full writeup, I will provide that on my personal website with each topic that needs to be known and where to learn them for each problem. Hoping to break down my solution section by section explaining why and how to help others solve the problem!
